# PricePred
Master's dissertation project
Tried and tested different regression models on the London Housing dataset.
The project was started by doing EDA by which the outliers were detected.
The outliers were then systematically cleaned to train the model.
K-NN regressor proved to be the best model according to the metrics.
The same model was used in a website that was deployed to predict prices of properties based on the user's input
